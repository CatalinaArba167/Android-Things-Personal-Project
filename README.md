# Pre-requisites
- Arduino Board: An Arduino Uno is recommended for beginners due to its ease of use and wide support.
- Piezo Buzzer: This acts as the output device for playing the melody.
- Push Button: Used to start the melody. When pressed, the Arduino will play "Baby Shark."
- Breadboard: Facilitates easy connections between the Arduino, piezo buzzer, button, potentiometer, and resistor without soldering.
- Jumper Wires: To make connections between the Arduino board, breadboard, and all components.
- USB Cable: To connect the Arduino to your computer for programming and power.


# Setup and Build

- Software part
  - Download "Arduino IDE" in your computer
  - Create a circuit project
  - Write the code from above
  - Check for errors
  - Save the code
  - Select the board (Arduino 1R3)  and the port (COM3)
  - Upload the code on the board
 
- Hardware part
  - Build the circuit on the breadboard and connect the components exactly as in the picture from above

- The project is ready to be tested


# Running

-It is enough to push the button from the breadfoard to start the sequence
